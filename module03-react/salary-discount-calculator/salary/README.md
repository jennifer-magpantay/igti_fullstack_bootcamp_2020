### Create a React application using functional components & Hooks

**Practical work of the FullStack BootCamp held by IGTI**

Getting deep into functional components, participants of the BootCamp were asked to develope an React application called Salary Calculator, which is self explanatory: the application has to calculate the percentagens and discounts over a minimal wage typed by the user. The calculation methods were developed by the lecture, Raphael Gomide, and its content and the logic are based on labor discount rules, currently in force in Brazil.

The project challenges involved:

1. Create a React application using functional components
2. Use Hooks to set states and methods
3. Add to the App components to hold the input and to read the results
4. Format the number according to each style
5. Add a progress bar to visually represent the values of each calculation
6. Add style using css modules
