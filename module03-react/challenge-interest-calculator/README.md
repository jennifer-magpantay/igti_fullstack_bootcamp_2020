## IGTI Fullstack Bootcamp | Module 03: React

As final pratical work of the React module, students were required to develop an application to perform valuation / depreciation calculation based on initial capital, monthly interest rate and number of monthly installments, using the concept of compound interest.

### Goals

The required tasks involved:

1. Creating a react project using functional components
2. Defining the states for the application, considering the information to be perfomed
3. Developing the app considering the following points:
   The interest rate can be either positive (investment) or negative (depreciation);
   Implement the input fields as "number";
   Set the capital with initial and minimum value of 100;
   Set the monthly interest rates between -12 and 12;
   Set the term between 1 and 36;
   The calcuation function and formating should be researched and built
   Implement the calculation by useEffecct;
   For the application, work around <App>, <Form>, <Installments> and <Installment> as components;
   Add style to differentiate investments(blue) from depreciation (red);

   ### Status
