### Create a React application using functional components

**Practical work of the FullStack BootCamp held by IGTI**

First steps into functional components, the task will involve the conversion of the app called counter-app from class components to functional components, when it is apropriatte to do so.

As a review of what is the task: participants of the BootCamp were asked to develope an application called Counter, which by its name, is self explanatory: the application has to control the value of a counter according to the clicks of its buttons.

The challenges involved:

1. create a React application using functional components called Counter
2. set its states (by using useState), add buttons as components, with its own props and methods to handle the events
3. add to the App two counters and make sure their events are independent from one another
4. make the correct imports, when it is necessary
5. add style using css modules - I also have used BEM as naming convention ... just because!
