# Grades Control API

## IGTI Fullstack Bootcamp | Module 02: Node

Exploring the Node.js module, participants were asked to build an API called 'grades-control-api' which allow a user to create, read, update and delete grades by using a given json file and endpoints for each CRUD method.

### Goals

The challenges involved:

1. create an endpoint to create a new grade and save it into the json file;
2. create an endpoint to update a grade, using as params: id, student, subject, type and value;
3. create an endpoint to delete a grade, using id as param;
4. create an endpoint to get an grade by its id;
5. create and endpoint to check the total grades of a student in a specific subject, using as params: student and subject values;
6. create an endpoint to calculate the average grade of a specific subject and type, using them as params;
7. create an endpoint to return 3 greater grades according to a specific subject and type.
