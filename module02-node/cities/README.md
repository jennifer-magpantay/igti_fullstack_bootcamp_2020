### Create an Node.js application to manupulate a JSON file

**Practical work of the FullStack BootCamp held by IGTI**

As part of the Node.js module, students were required to build an Node application to manipulate JSON files and objects. Two files were given: Estados.json, which holds all states from Brazil, and Cidades.json, which holds all cities from Brazil.

Tasks involved:

1. Create a function to generate a JSON file for each state from Estados.json file. Each generated file has to be named by its UF(ex.: MG.json) and holds all its own related cities;
2. Create a function that has to use a UF as params and returns its all cities;
3. Create a function to display an array with a top five list of the states with more cities registered;
4. Create a function to display an array with a top five list of the states with less cities registered;
5. Create a function to display an array with the cities with the longest names registered of each state;
6. Create a function to display an array with the cities with the shortest names registered of each state;
7. Create a function to return the city with longest name;
8. Create a function to return the city with shortest name;

Things to consider: 
- Longest/shortest names according to the only number of characteres - do not consider spaces;
- Cities with the same number of characters should be sorted by alphabetic order, and then, return the first index.
