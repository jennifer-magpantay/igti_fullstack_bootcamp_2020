# my-bank-api

### Create an CRUD API by using endpoints with Node.js and Express.

**Practical work of the FullStack BootCamp held by IGTI**

Exploring the first content of the Node.js module, a simple API called 'my-bank-api' was built to get used to the Express, setting routes, creation and application of CRUD methods and endpoints, using Postman.

Tasks involved:
1) create an json file to hold the information from API;
2) create an endpoint to create a new account, using id, name and balance as params;
3) create an endpoint to update the whole content of a account, by using put()
4) create an endpoint to update the balance account, by using patch()
5) create an endpoint to delete aa account, using id as param;
6) create an endpoint to find an account using its id as param;
7) add to your API input validation.
