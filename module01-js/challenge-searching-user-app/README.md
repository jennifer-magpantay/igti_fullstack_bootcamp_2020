# Searching Application

## IGTI Fullstack Bootcamp | Module 01: JavaScript

Develop an interactive searching application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript to get and to search information from API by HTTP fetch request.

### Goals

Implement events to DOM elements and get data by using fetch requests.

Requirements:
- Elements of the application: input field, search button, clear button and two columns for results - empty fields are not allowed;
- Activate the search event when the key enter or the button search is pressed or when the user just types in the input fields;
- The search should works in a synchronized mode: as the user types, the results pop up on screen. This is possible using methods to map, filter and check if the data API includes values from the input field;
- Return for results from the API: picture, full name, age and gender of registered people;
- Completing the application, a bunch of statistics should be display on screen such as total of female, female, sum and average of ages, regarding the search results.
